This is a benchmark tool that uses the same code as producer.go and consumer.go. It needs to accept a destination broker and a receiver broker, so you can send messages to one active ActiveMQ broker and consume them from another (or the same) broker.

The tool needs to take parameters for the message size and the duration the test should run. For example, if you specify 1 second, it will send messages for 1 second, then consume them back, and calculate the time spent on sending and consuming the messages.

The output should include:

    The speed of sending messages
    The speed of consuming messages
    The total time the test took

There needs to be a parameter for the queue name.

there is going to be a parameter called prometheus-out that takes a file destination, that generates a .prom file for the node exporter to prometheus, so the metrics can be scraped

The Prometheus metrics include labels for sender and receiver broker addresses, allowing metrics to be tracked per broker configuration.

the golang progran is going to be called activemq-benchmark
